# Rebecca Kahler - Heisman Candidate Analysis

The purpose of this repo is to serve as a source for all of the components of my final tutroiral Heisman Candidate Analysis.

The motivation behind this project is to explore whether or not the Heisman continues to be awarded to the top college football player, or if helmet bias and position have any affect on voting results.

The data for this project is scraped entirely from https://www.sports-reference.com and https://www.wikipedia.org.
